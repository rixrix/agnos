  Supported Languages
  ------------------
  PHP is the current supported language for its unit testing. Most test files
  written in PHP-QAT testing framework are 95% compatible with agnos engine.
  Please see limitations section for additional informations.

  Basic Test Results Reporting
  ----------------------------

  agnos has a basic mechanism for generating reports after running the
  tests. Reports are saved in agnos-reports/ directory in text file format.

  Support for individual and recursive directory testing
  ----------------------------------------------------

  agnos supports testing for individual and recursive directory
  testing. agnos permits users to specify single/multiple invidual testfile
  from different directories. Multiple recursive directory testing is also
  supported in this release.

  Command Line Switches
  ---------------------
  agnos supports UNIX style CLI switches for invoking commands.

  Known Bugs and Limitations
  --------------------------
  agnos doesn't support all of the PHP-QAT testing formats as this was too
  specific for their language/configuration and usage.
  A new/different format will be introduce on the next release.

  This release only supports PHP language. Additional language support is one of
  our main TODO for next few releases.
