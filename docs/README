agnos 0.0.1
---------------

agnos is a language agnostic unit testing framework for agile development. 
It allows one to write tests in different languages and the framework will take 
care of running the test files. The framework follow some of the TAP protocol 
formats popularized by Perl Test::modules and PHP-QAT runtest framework 

Objectives
----------

    * Quick unit testing
    * Simple and ridiculous easy test formats
    * Automate the regression/testing process
    * Execute test suites
    * Generate associated test reports
    * TAP(Test Anything Protocol) Compliant

System Requirements and Installation
************************************

agnos has been developed and tested on Linux platform specifically 
distro but other linux distro would be fine including 
those UNIX like operating systems.
	
	Minimum Software Requirements
	-----------------------------
	
		- Linux 2.6.xx (Ubuntu)	
		- PHP 5.2.6
		
	Installation
	------------
	
	The method of instalation depends on whether you have downloaded the tar
	or zip file distribution, or you have a Subversion store checkout.
	
	1. Place the agnos/ directory in /opt location.
	2. You need to set up the environment variable PHP and set it to the binary 
	   location of your PHP binary. agnos will then look for this entry when
	   it is invoked in command line.
	   
	   	e.g.
	   		PHP=/usr/local/bin/php
	   		
	3. Change agnos.php file mode to an executable file by issuing the 
       following commands :
		e.g.
			chmod +x agnos.php
	
	Note
	-----
	agnos, as of this release doesn't include an automated install script so
	you are on your own to place the agnos src according to your preference.
	We do however recommend to place the agnos directory under /opt directory.
